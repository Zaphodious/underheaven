+ [ ] Ocean Father tasks the player to get him
  + [ ] "The last stone at the bottom of this cave, from the room with walls the color of a harvest sunrise"

+ [ ] Upon returning, the Ocean Father instructs them to throw the stone over the edge and listen for it to splash, or applauds them for being wise and honest. If they return with an ordinary stone, he chides them for dishonesty and punishes them with an assult from fog sharks
