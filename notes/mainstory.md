The players have arrived at the dias after the long climb. A small pagoda temple stands on the other side, serving as the temple.

+ [x] Players spend the first night around a campfire.
+ [x] After the convo dies down, cut to three/four days later
+ [x] The gods in attendance give the players a brief lecture on the nature of teamwork, asking them to reflect on the climb
+ [x] Ocean Father tasks the player to get him
  + [x] "The last stone at the bottom of this cave, from the room with walls the color of a harvest sunrise"
  + In reality, said room caontains no loose stones, and the walls require great effort to mar.
+ [x] The players enter the cavern, and slowly notice that it is getting extremely cold.
  + Hazard, 1b per .5hr difficulty 2. Very, very cold. 
+ [x] In the cavern, is a god of disease (pg 509 core book)
  + [x] He has a small army of puppet corpses with active lepracy
    + [x] These corpses are manouvered to intercept and "hug" the heroes
  + [ ] He never directly faces the players if the can help it
+ [ ] Further in, there is a long drop that must be descended
+ [ ] Before the room, there is a long series of maze-like naturally-occuring mini-caves obscuring the way forward
+ [ ] The room itself is so cold that the check increases to once every five minutes
+ [ ] Upon returning, the Ocean Father instructs them to throw the stone over the edge and listen for it to splash, or applauds them for being wise and honest. If they return with an ordinary stone, he chides them for dishonesty and punishes them with an assult from fog sharks
